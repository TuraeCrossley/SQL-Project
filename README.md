Advanced SQL Analysis on an E-Commerce Dataset

Language Used: Structured Query Language (SQL)

Number of Tables: 6 (Orders, OrderDetails, Products, Employees, Orders_1, and Customers)

Project Description:

This comprehensive data analysis project uses advanced SQL on an E-commerce dataset. Six tables are used in this project: Orders, OrderDetails, Products, Employees, Orders_1, and Customers.

Key segments of this project include:

Order Analysis with Window Functions: SQL window functions are used to generate line numbers for each order for better tracking and auditing.

Inventory Analysis with Case Statements: The stock level of products is categorized into different levels using SQL case statements, assisting real-time inventory management.

Order Trend Analysis: SQL Date functions are utilized to understand the monthly order trends for the year 1997.

Manager-Employee Mapping using CTE: SQL Common Table Expressions (CTE) are used to create a reporting hierarchy of the employees.

Order History Tracking: SQL subqueries are utilized to get the previous order ID for each record.

Yearly Order Analysis using Views and Running Totals: SQL views and subqueries are used to calculate the running total of orders by year.

Top Customer Identification: SQL aggregate and sorting functions are employed to identify the customer with the most orders.

Employee Performance Evaluation using Pivot Tables: SQL case statements and aggregate functions are used to create a pivot table summarizing employee performance.

Order Aggregation using Rollup: SQL Rollup operator is used to group orders based on Year, Month, and Date.

Data Integration with Merge Statements: SQL merge statement is used to synchronize customer information from a staging table to the main table.

Overall, this project demonstrates the power of SQL in performing complex data analysis, generating insights, and managing databases efficiently.
